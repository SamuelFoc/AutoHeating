The Arduino Thermostat Library is a C++ library designed to provide thermostat functionality to your Arduino-based projects. With this library, you can easily create a thermostat control system for temperature regulation in your home automation, greenhouse, or other applications.

## Features

- **Temperature Control:** Set and maintain a desired temperature within a defined range.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple API for setting the target temperature and reading current temperature.
- **Reliable:** Implements hysteresis to prevent rapid heating and cooling cycles (commonly known as "short cycling").
- **Compatibility:** Works with a variety of temperature sensors and heating/cooling devices.
- **Customizable:** Adjust parameters like hysteresis, control intervals, and sensor type to suit your needs.

## Installation

To use this library in your Arduino project, follow these steps:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SamuelFoc/AutoHeating) of the library as a ZIP file.

2. Open the Arduino IDE and go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Add .ZIP Library...`.

3. Select the downloaded ZIP file and click `Open`.

4. The library is now installed and ready to use in your sketches.
